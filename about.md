We are all better after reading that. I am sure if I say something stupid enough my employer may still find something else for me to do.

#### 10.2The Book

This site is the home for all I know about the world of Identity and Access management from an architectâ€™s point of view. It is being pulled together in a book form.

The tool I used to produce the book is Scribble. Scribble is a great vehicle for capturing your book in a format that is not specific to any output like HTML. Scribble can be used to generate static web-sites, a PDF, or even a very detailed Latex document.

Take a look at[Scribble: The Racket Documentation Tool](https://docs.racket-lang.org/scribble/)if you want to produce similar output. Another tool is[Pollen](http://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/)which is a superset of Scribble and can be used to deliver exact, along with very pretty, typesetting requirements. For now I like the documentation look of Scribble.
